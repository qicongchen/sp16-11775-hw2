# An example script for multimedia event detection (MED) of Homework 1
# Before running this script, you are supposed to have the features by running run.feature.sh 

# Note that this script gives you the very basic setup. Its configuration is by no means the optimal. 
# This is NOT the only solution by which you approach the problem. We highly encourage you to create
# your own setups.
